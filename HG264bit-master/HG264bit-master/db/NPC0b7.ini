description=""CSAT have surprised us. They have been spotted arriving from the coast to the south.<br/><br/>The final part of the plan is to take the large town to the north, but we need to secure our southern territory first.<br/><br/>There is rumor of a recon squad observing us from this position. We need to stop them so CSAT cannot form a good plan of attack. There are apparently 8 special forces units.<br/><br/>Eliminate the small recon squad hiding somewhere in the highlighted area.<br/><br/>Supplies for the mission are stored in the supply box.""
